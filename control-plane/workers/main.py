"""Verdent Platform — worker service entrypoint (Railway service: `worker`).

Per Dockerfile: start = `python -m workers.main`

Responsibilities (Document 6 §N — all sub-5-minute loops live here, not in
Railway cron):
  1. Job queue consumer (provisioning retries — Phase 2)
  2. Usage reconciliation loop (Phase 5 — repairs aggregate drift)
  3. Node health-check loop (Phase 2/3 — hysteresis + failover)
  4. Quota/expiry push loop (Phase 5 — disable over-quota credentials at the edge)
